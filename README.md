# Fast Payments processing with Checkout Bricks

[Português](README.pt.md) / [Español](README.es.md)

> **Note:** Fast Payments is currently available only for selected merchants. We are working to make it available to everyone soon.

## :computer: Technologies

- Node.js
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) (dependency manager)
- Express

## 💡 Requirements

- Node.js v20.11.1 or higher (you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/)).
- [Read our instructions](https://www.mercadopago.com/developers/en/docs/getting-started) on how to create an application at the Mercado Pago Developer Panel in order to acquire your public key and access token. They will grant you access to Mercado Pago's public APIs.

## :gear: Installation

1. Clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mercadopago/payment-brick-fast-payments-sample.git
```

2. Go to the project's folder.

```bash
cd payment-brick-fast-payments-sample
```

3. Then install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## 🌟 How to run it

Fast Payments are only available on mobile devices. Therefore, to test this integration, you must either use an Android/iOS emulator or access it directly from your mobile device. To make it easier to access this project's content on these devices, we'll use localtunnel.

1. Run the following command to start the application:

```bash
MERCADO_PAGO_SAMPLE_PUBLIC_KEY=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY MERCADO_PAGO_SAMPLE_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN npm start
``` 

Remember to replace the values of `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` and `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the corresponding [credentials](https://www.mercadopago.com/developers/panel) from your account.

2. Run the following command in a new terminal window to create a tunnel:
```bash
npm run localtunnel
```

3. Access the public URL generated by the previous command through your mobile device or emulator.
